# Arithmetic-Function-Tools
Various functions designed to replicate the behavior of various arithmetic functions. 
I'd recommend reading this article if you're unfamiliar with arithmetic functions: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_function

The functions implimented can be found in numberTheoryTools.py. Descriptions and explainations for how these functions work can be found in the src

graphing.py is intented to be used to graph the relationship between an arithmetic functions. To graph a function, replace the noted line in graphing.py (ln ) with the function of your choice, then run graphing.py from the terminal (python graphing.py). An interactive graph will open in your default browser once it has completed making the data set.
